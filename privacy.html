      This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use the Monk Watch application (the "App"). By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      The App may collect limited information necessary for functionality, such as device information, app usage data, and purchase status (if applicable). We do not collect personally identifiable information unless you voluntarily provide it to us for support.
    </p>

    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>
      We use collected information to operate and improve the App, verify purchases, ensure proper functionality, and maintain security. We may use aggregated, non-identifiable data for analytics and performance improvements.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      The App may integrate third-party services (e.g., Google Play Billing). These services may collect information in accordance with their own privacy policies. Please review their policies for details.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      We retain data only as long as necessary to provide the App and comply with legal obligations. When no longer needed, data is deleted or anonymized.
    </p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
      We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect your information. However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure.
    </p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The App is not directed to children where parental consent is required by law. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
    </p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>
      Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, or delete your information. To exercise these rights, please contact us using the details below.
